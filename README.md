# What is Cookie Consent?
Cookie Consent is a lightweight JavaScript plugin for alerting users about the use of cookies on your website.
It is designed to help you comply with the hideous EU Cookie Law.

## Installation
```
npm install @kraftvaerk/cookieconsent
```

## Usage
```javascript
import CookieConsent from '@kraftvaerk/cookieconsent';

const cookieConsent = new CookieConsent({
    cookieName: 'cookieConsent',
    btn: {
        accept: 'js-cookie-accept',
        close: 'js-cookie-close'
    }
    toggleClass: 'is-shown'
});

cookieConsent.onCheck(()=>{});
cookieConsent.onAccept(()=>{});
cookieConsent.onShow(()=>{});
cookieConsent.onHide(()=>{});

cookieConsent.init('#cookieConsent');
```
